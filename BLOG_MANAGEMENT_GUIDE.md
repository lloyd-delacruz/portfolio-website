# üìö Blog Management Guide - Complete Workflow

## üéØ Overview

Your blog system is **file-driven** - meaning you manage content by adding, editing, or deleting Markdown files. No database required!

**Key Location**: All blog posts live in `/frontend/content/blog/`

## ‚úçÔ∏è Adding New Blog Posts

### Method 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run create-post
```

The script will ask you:
1. **Title** - Your blog post title
2. **Excerpt** - Brief 1-2 sentence description  
3. **Category** - Choose: `healthcare`, `development`, `data-science`, `ai`, `technology`
4. **Tags** - Comma-separated (e.g., "Python, Healthcare, AI")
5. **Featured** - Should this appear prominently? (y/n)
6. **Interactive** - Does it have interactive elements? (y/n)  
7. **Video** - Does it contain videos? (y/n)

**Example workflow:**
```

tags: ["Healthcare", "AI", "Technology", "Data Science"]
readTime: "8 min read"
featured: false
image: "/images/blog/your-post-slug.jpg"
video: false

## üìù Content Writing Tips

### Frontmatter Best Practices
```markdown
---
title: "Clear, Descriptive Title Under 60 Characters"
excerpt: "Compelling description that makes people want to read more. Keep under 160 characters for SEO."
date: "2024-07-28"  # Use YYYY-MM-DD format
author: "Lloyd Dela Cruz"
category: "healthcare"  # Use lowercase, one word
tags: ["Specific", "Searchable", "Terms", "Max 6 Tags"]
readTime: "8 min read"  # Calculate ~200 words per minute
featured: true  # Only for your best content

video: false
interactive: false  # Set true if you have React components
gradient: "from-cyan-600 via-blue-600 to-indigo-800"
published: true  # Set false to draft
---
```

### Markdown Writing Guide

**Headers:**
```markdown
# Main Title (H1) - Only one per post
## Section Header (H2)  
### Subsection (H3)
#### Detail Header (H4)
```

**Code blocks with syntax highlighting:**
```markdown
```python
def healthcare_analysis():
    return "Your code here"
```
```

**Lists:**
```markdown
- Bullet point
- Another point
  - Nested point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item
   1. Nested number
```

**Links:**
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[Internal link](/about)
```

**Emphasis:**
```markdown
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
`Inline code`
```

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Search | Real-time search | ‚úÖ |
| Filter | Category filtering | ‚úÖ |
```

## üîç Managing Categories and Tags

### Current Categories
- `healthcare` - Medical AI, health informatics, digital health
- `development` - Software development, programming tutorials
- `data-science` - Analytics, machine learning, statistics  
- `ai` - Artificial intelligence applications
- `technology` - General tech topics, emerging trends

### Tag Strategy
**Good tags** (specific, searchable):
- `Python`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Next.js`
- `Machine Learning`, `Data Visualization` 
- `Healthcare AI`, `Medical Devices`, `EHR Systems`
- `AWS`, `Cloud Computing`, `DevOps`

**Avoid** (too generic):
- `Technology`, `Programming`, `Data`

## üéØ SEO Optimization

### Titles
- **Keep under 60 characters**
- **Include keywords naturally**
- **Make it compelling**

**Good**: "Building Real-Time Healthcare Dashboards with React and WebSockets"
**Bad**: "My Tutorial About Dashboards"

### Excerpts  
- **Keep under 160 characters**
- **Include primary keywords**
- **Create urgency/curiosity**

**Good**: "Learn to build HIPAA-compliant healthcare dashboards that update in real-time, improving patient care through better data visualization."

### Images
- **Use descriptive filenames**: `healthcare-dashboard-mockup.jpg`
- **Add alt text**: `![Healthcare dashboard showing patient vitals in real-time](/images/blog/dashboard.jpg)`
- **Optimize file sizes**: Use WebP when possible

## üöÄ Publishing Workflow

### Before Publishing
1. **Spell check** your content
2. **Test code examples** - make sure they work
3. **Optimize images** - compress large files
4. **Preview locally**:
