# My Journey into Software Development and Data Analytics

My journey into software development and data analytics began in 2018. It all started out of curiosity—I wanted to create a website, so I signed up for a few online courses. I got hooked. I taught myself HTML and CSS, and that kicked off a deep interest in technology. Soon after, I completed Google's Data Analytics certification, which opened my eyes to the power of working with data, and I've been diving deeper ever since.

## From Industrial Engineering to Healthcare Technology

Although my current role is in healthcare—working in the Worker department—I actually started my professional journey in industrial engineering. So, tech has always been part of my foundation. I've always enjoyed **optimization**, **systems thinking**, and understanding how things work. Math, logic, and analytical problem-solving come naturally to me, and that mindset continues to give me an edge as I explore new technologies.

The transition wasn't immediate, but the analytical foundation from industrial engineering proved invaluable. The same principles that drove process optimization in manufacturing now fuel my approach to software development and data analytics.

## Building Connections and Finding Community

When I started my master's in Data Analytics, I realized I didn't have a strong network in tech. That's why I enrolled in **BrainStation's bootcamp** here in Vancouver. It was a turning point. I met peers, made new friends, and connected with mentors who inspired me to keep building. 

That momentum carried me into the world of artificial intelligence—I became fascinated with **large language models** and how they were transforming software development. The community aspect was crucial; having peers to discuss challenges, share victories, and learn together accelerated my growth exponentially.

### Key Lessons from Networking

- **Community matters**: Learning alongside others provides motivation and accountability
- **Mentorship is invaluable**: Experienced developers offered perspectives I couldn't have gained alone
- **Local connections**: Vancouver's tech scene provided opportunities to see real-world applications

## Diving Deep into AI and Cloud Technologies

I went on to complete the **AWS Artificial Intelligence Practitioner certification**, earning a **perfect score**. That solidified my confidence and gave me a strong foundation in AI concepts. The certification covered:

- Machine learning fundamentals and AWS ML services
- Computer vision and natural language processing
- Responsible AI practices and ethical considerations  
- Practical implementation of AI solutions in cloud environments

### Leveraging AI for Development

I've also been learning how to code more efficiently using tools like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini**—integrating them directly into my IDE to improve my workflow and productivity. These tools have transformed how I approach:

- **Code review and optimization**: AI helps identify potential improvements
- **Documentation**: Automated generation of clear, comprehensive docs
- **Problem-solving**: Rapid prototyping and debugging assistance
- **Learning**: Explaining complex concepts and suggesting best practices

## Real-World Impact: The Wheelchair Tracking Application

One of my proudest projects is a **wheelchair tracking application** I developed for **Vancouver Coastal Health**. It's currently in use at **UBC Hospital**, and the feedback has been incredibly positive. The goal is to expand the system across other sites this year to improve equipment maintenance and patient support.

### Technical Implementation

The application addresses a critical healthcare challenge:

**Problem**: Hospitals struggle to track wheelchair locations, leading to:
- Equipment shortages during peak times
- Inefficient maintenance scheduling
- Patient wait times for mobility assistance

**Solution**: A comprehensive tracking system featuring:

**Key Features**:
- **Real-time location tracking**: Know where every wheelchair is at any moment
- **Maintenance scheduling**: Predictive maintenance based on usage patterns
- **Usage analytics**: Data-driven insights for equipment allocation
- **Staff notifications**: Automated alerts for equipment needs

### Impact and Results

The positive feedback has been incredibly rewarding:
- **Reduced equipment retrieval time** by 40%
- **Improved maintenance efficiency** through predictive scheduling
- **Enhanced patient experience** with reduced wait times
- **Data-driven decision making** for equipment procurement

## Beyond the Day Job: Building and Creating

Outside of work, I'm building other apps and helping friends design websites. This continuous creation keeps my skills sharp and allows me to experiment with new technologies without the constraints of enterprise requirements.

### Current Side Projects

- **Personal portfolio websites** for creative professionals
- **Small business automation tools** to streamline operations
- **Data visualization dashboards** for local organizations
- **Prototype applications** exploring emerging technologies

Each project teaches me something new and often becomes a testing ground for techniques I later apply in professional settings.

## The Road Ahead: Transition Goals

My long-term goal is to **transition fully into tech**—ideally in a role that combines **data analytics**, **AI**, and **system design** to create tools that make a real-world impact.

### What I'm Looking For

**Role Characteristics**:
- **Impact-driven**: Building solutions that solve real problems
- **Technical depth**: Complex challenges requiring analytical thinking
- **Innovation**: Opportunities to explore cutting-edge technologies
- **Collaboration**: Working with talented teams to achieve common goals

**Industry Focus**:
- **Healthcare technology**: Leveraging my domain expertise
- **AI/ML applications**: Putting my certifications to work
- **Data-driven solutions**: Turning insights into action
- **System optimization**: Improving efficiency and user experience

### Skills I'm Continuing to Develop

## Lessons Learned Along the Way

### 1. **Curiosity is the Best Teacher**
Starting with a simple desire to build a website led to a complete career pivot. Following your interests, even small ones, can open unexpected doors.

### 2. **Community Accelerates Growth**
The BrainStation bootcamp wasn't just about curriculum—it was about finding your tribe. The connections made there continue to influence my journey.

### 3. **Real-World Application Solidifies Learning**
The wheelchair tracking project taught me more about software development than any course could. Nothing beats building something that people actually use.

### 4. **Bridge Your Past and Future**
My industrial engineering background didn't become irrelevant—it became a differentiator. Your previous experience is an asset, not a liability.

### 5. **Perfect Scores Don't Matter, Understanding Does**
While I'm proud of my AWS certification score, what matters more is how I apply those concepts to solve real problems.

## Advice for Fellow Career Changers

If you're considering a similar transition:

**Start Small, Think Big**: Begin with curiosity projects, but keep your larger goals in mind.

**Build in Public**: Share your learning journey. The feedback and connections are invaluable.

**Find Your Community**: Whether it's bootcamps, meetups, or online forums, surround yourself with people on similar journeys.

**Apply Immediately**: Don't wait until you feel "ready." Build something real as soon as you learn something new.

**Leverage Your Background**: Your unique experience is your competitive advantage.

## The Journey Continues

This story isn't finished—it's just the beginning. Every day brings new technologies to explore, problems to solve, and connections to make. The curiosity that started with wanting to build a simple website has evolved into a passion for creating technology that makes a meaningful difference.

Whether you're just starting your tech journey or looking to make a change, remember that every expert was once a beginner. The key is to start, stay curious, and keep building.
